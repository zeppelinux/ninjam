This is NINJAM, www.ninjam.com

To build the server, go to ninjam/server and run make

The various clients in ninjam/ are all old and probably need some attention to function

The REAPER ReaNINJAM plug-in is in jmde/fx/reaninjam/. It is more fully featured. You will need the VST2 SDK to compile it, though.
